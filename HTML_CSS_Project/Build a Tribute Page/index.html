            <p id="tribute-info">Hedy Lamarr is best known as a Hollywood superstar, so you might be wondering why she’s on our list of women programmers, but off-screen, Lamarr was known for her dedication to her other passions: science and inventing. In fact, she created the communication system that would later become the basis for WiFi, GPS, and Bluetooth.

 That invention, originally a radio guidance system, helped the Allies win the Second World War. That was the whole point: to use different frequencies to guide underwater missiles and render them undetectable. Sadly, despite having patented the technology—which was subsequently used by the military—Lamarr and her family have never seen a cent in return for its use during the war or in subsequent modern technologies, and you probably had no idea how this Hollywood star changed the face of technology.
